There are many students who want to seek help in various domains, but they often don&apos;t know who to reach out to. On the other hand, there are many seniors and alumni who have valuable experience and knowledge in these fields, but they don&apos;t always have an easy way to connect with students who need their help. That&apos;s why we created ConnectLNM. Our platform serves as an online directory of experts within our university, providing an easy and user-friendly way for juniors to find seniors and alumni with the specific skills and expertise they need.</p>

We believe that ConnectLNM has the potential to transform the way that students and alumni connect and collaborate within our university. By bridging the gap between juniors and seniors/alumni, we can create a more cohesive and supportive community that fosters learning and growth for all.‚úîÔ∏è</p>
